cardObjects: [
		{ name: "The Fool"
		, relationships: "There's a reason we say we fall in love! Each new romance makes us as giddy as a total beginner. Don't allow old habits to smother opportunities for growth. You can break rules without resorting to rash action and you don't have to be in control all the time."
		, work: "Leap over limits. Don't waver; now's the time to jump, even if you don't have all the facts in hand. Remember that once, every new direction was just another crazy idea. Be prepared, though. Later, your results will determine whether others deem you clever or crazy." 
		, spirituality: "You are old and young, wise and inexperienced. Life is a cycle of cycles; find your place in the dance and start dancing. Reinvention is the key to transformation. See who you are, but acknowledge, too, the person you can be. Grace abounds; embrace it. Consider Zen meditation."
		, personalGrowth: "Without falling for every scheme that comes your way, you can cultivate an openness to life. What are your limits? What boundaries define you? What might happen if you step outside those definitions? With eyes wide open, expand your world today."
		, fortuneTelling: "Watch for new projects and new beginnings. Prepare to take something on faith. Something new comes your way; go for it."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Magician"
		, relationships: "A relationship should empower you. Does yours generate positive change in your life? Do you feel happier and more fulfilled? A relationship that supports your goals is to be valued; a relationship that doesn't must be changed or cast aside."
		, work: "Exercise whatever authority you have. With the right resources, you'll succeed. But not everyone who appears empowered really is. With an eye toward growth, seek allies who focus on steak, not sizzle. Be a mentor ... or find one. Deploy tools and resources against well-defined goals." 
		, spirituality: "If others were to see you and your life as an expression of the Divine, what would their impression of the Divine be? How can you improve that perception? How can you better dedicate yourself to being a channel for positive energy in the world?"
		, personalGrowth: "Asserting yourself can be an important step toward wholeness. When your work or life experience has given you special insights or talents, shrug off self-doubt and apply them fearlessly. Act confidently, and feelings of confidence will follow."
		, fortuneTelling: "A powerful man may play a role in your day. Your current situation must be seen as one element of a much larger plan."
		},
		
		{ name: "The High Priestess"
		, relationships: "Your heart is your best source of information now; listen to it. Set, communicate, and respect sexual limits. Don't tell everything you know; one element of attraction is mystery. Still, don't be a puzzle; communicate your needs and the reasons for them. Watch and learn."
		, work: "Play your cards close to the vest. Reveal your insights to a chosen few. Rather than take rash action now, keep still and observe. Hold your tongue and learn by listening. Listen to your gut instincts. When the time comes for action, you'll know." 
		, spirituality: "The unconventional image of a papess recalls the legend of the heretical, cross-dressing Pope Joan, whose true gender was revealed when she unexpectedly gave birth. Consider alternative spiritual paths or nontraditional applications of your familiar faith."
		, personalGrowth: "Learning to listen can be the most difficult lesson of all. Invest energy in the transformational discipline of silence. Disengaging from the drive to respond will free you to reflect. As an observer, you will see patterns participants will overlook."
		, fortuneTelling: "A mysterious woman arrives. A sexual secret may surface. Someone knows more than he or she will reveal."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Empress"
		, relationships: "Without going overboard, revel in your sensuality. Take care you don't produce more than you intended; the moment is pregnant with possibility. Be lavish with demonstrations of affection. Watch for what a friend or partner needs, and then supply it in abundance."
		, work: "Now is the time to get things done. Wrap up projects. Ask for resources. Meet deadlines. Move ahead. During this time of growth and expansion, be sure you have the skills and training you need. In the meantime, don't mistake a headlong rush for focused, verifiable progress." 
		, spirituality: "Women are the figurative and literal door to this world. This moment, too, can be a door for you√ëa threshold you cross into a new awareness. Watch for physical ways to express your spiritual insights. Reconnect with nurturing, feminine images of divinity, including nature."
		, personalGrowth: "Your attitudes toward women (and your insights into your own feminine qualities) are likely rooted in early experiences. How can you emulate the best female role models you've encountered? How can you transcend female influences that harm or hold you back?"
		, fortuneTelling: "Pregnancy is in the cards. An opportunity to be involved in luxurious sexuality is coming. Beware a tendency toward addiction."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Emperor"
		, relationships: "Without becoming false or deceptive, you can regulate your feelings and reactions. Beware the need to always be in control; a healthy relationship incorporates a fair division of labor. Be on the lookout for subtle and not-so-subtle efforts to wear the pants in the relationship."
		, work: "Efficient groups depend on centralized control. Seek ways to direct the flow without micromanaging the process. Encourage leaders (including yourself) to step up to the plate and embrace their obligations. Control what you can; don't worry about the rest." 
		, spirituality: "The stereotypical view of religion casts organized faith in restrictive terms. Rather than be constrained by structure, consider how structure and discipline might enhance your spiritual experience. Seek guidance and direction from those who have walked the path before you."
		, personalGrowth: "In what ways do your attitudes toward authority seem to be shaped by your relationship with your father? A mature person recognizes that structure and authority are a requirement of civilization. Some resist purely out of habit or stubbornness; when you buck the system, be sure you have good reason to do so."
		, fortuneTelling: "A father figure arrives. A new employer or authority figure will give you orders. Expect discipline or correction in the near future."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Hierophant"
		, relationships: "A relationship should be more than just going through the motions. Seek the deeper meaning of small gestures and daily chores. Emphasize signs that those involved have real faith in the partnership. If necessary, seek guidance from a spiritual leader or counselor."
		, work: "Seek training or a mentor, particularly if you are having difficulty understanding a complex assignment or when adjusting to new professional surroundings. See your daily work as an expression of your faith. Take traditional routes instead of innovative, unproven measures." 
		, spirituality: "See familiar spiritual symbols in a new light by pursuing a deeper understanding of them. If you're a lone practitioner, consider the value of joining a like-minded group or learning from a worthy teacher. What are the larger truths behind the rituals or stories you've learned?"
		, personalGrowth: "In time, everyone must deal with conflicts between experience and faith. Where do you find your personal center? Values dictate behavior, so work to define what you truly believe in. Don't shy away from the big questions, but be wary of gurus bearing quick answers."
		, fortuneTelling: "Expect to be caught in a misdeed and punished accordingly. Pray for forgiveness and confess wrongdoings. A more experienced man, spiritual leader, or father figure will come into your life."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Lovers"
		, relationships: "This is a time to celebrate unity, love, and romance in all its forms. Souls are coming together, and a unique opportunity exists for people to enjoy an unusual degree of interdependence and cooperation. Let your heart guide your choices today."
		, work: "Call group meetings, pursue mergers, and find solid business partners during this rare opportunity for successful cooperation. Pay special attention to opportunities to supply what others need. Lay a foundation for future success by watching for team members with skills you lack. Make choices based on what you truly enjoy doing." 
		, spirituality: "Open yourself to new and diverse spiritual experiences. See opportunities to love others (even romantically) as chances to be a channel for divine love. Every small blessing you receive is an expression of universal love; give thanks and embrace what life brings you."
		, personalGrowth: "Now is a good time to deal with outstanding issues related to sexuality and relationships. Rather than be overwhelmed with Hollywood-style passion, consider the extent to which your qualities might be balanced or enhanced by those of your potential partner. In other areas, find your passion and pursue it."
		, fortuneTelling: "A new personal or professional relationship blossoms. Sexual opportunities abound. Unexpectedly, a friend becomes a lover."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Chariot"
		, relationships: "Moving forward to mutual victory requires trust and cooperation. If you have this already, depend on it during an upcoming challenge. If you lack it, consider what choices have prevented forming this kind of bond. Don't rest on your laurels; successful romance is an ongoing commitment."
		, work: "What do you need to move forward? Now is the time to summon resources and plan for future success. Past successes might not be an indicator of current value. Remember that employers tend to ask What have you done for me lately? Work accordingly." 
		, spirituality: "Celebrate spiritual achievement, but be aware that a sense of having arrived can be the first step toward disastrous vanity. The goal is not to be a guru, but to achieve balance and stability. As you make progress, extend a helping hand to others who still await their chariot moment."
		, personalGrowth: "Reaching a new plane of maturity is exciting, so some celebration is in order. Every ending, though, is a new beginning; keep an eye fixed on further growth. Having reached the limits of mundane success, it's time to work on deeper transformation."
		, fortuneTelling: "Victory is a certainty. Move ahead with all plans. Beware the jealousy of others."
		},
		
		{ name: "Strength"
		, relationships: "You're in control. You can't tame others, but you can rein yourself in. Watch for old habits or weaknesses to surface, and use your wits to avoid upcoming pitfalls."
		, work: "Emotions and distractions can hinder progress. Identify the cause of dissention and take steps to moderate it. Allow people (including yourself) to do what they do best. An objective perspective yields more effective action." 
		, spirituality: "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Your own willpower may not be strong enough to resist the temptations that come your way. (That's okay; you're human.) Turn challenges over to a higher power, and allow yourself to be led."
		, personalGrowth: "Identify problematic habits and unhealthy tendencies, and weigh their overall impact on your life. Consider, too, the value of leaving these behind for healthier options. A good measure of maturity is the ability to forgo immediate gratification to reap benefits later."
		, fortuneTelling: "Your self-control will be tested. A woman will seek to change her partner or lover. You are a strong, capable person."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Hermit"
		, relationships: "Don't be afraid of being alone. Even the closest companions need some time apart. Being involved in a partnership does not eliminate your need to be your own person. To better please others, first learn how to please yourself."
		, work: "Sometimes, you have to close the door, forward calls to voice mail, and shut down your email client to get things done. Demand the space and time you need to get your assignment done. If you're overwhelmed, consider bringing in a consultant or an experienced aid." 
		, spirituality: "Learn to be still. Doing so is a challenge in today's hurly-burly world, but the skill offers many benefits. Focus on meditation; condition yourself to slow your thoughts and lower your blood pressure with a few measured breaths. Daily practice will make a huge difference in the quality of your life."
		, personalGrowth: "To be the best you can be, you must know who you really are. Reject the definitions others project on you. Search within. What do you really value? What do you really want to achieve? Empower yourself by embracing yourself, warts and all."
		, fortuneTelling: "A period of loneliness begins. One partner in a relationship departs. A search for love or money proves fruitless."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Wheel"
		, relationships: "You can't plan every moment. Be spontaneous. Rather than strive for control, let go of the reins and see where the relationship goes. Check your behaviors. Are you reliving mistakes of the past?"
		, work: "Feeling a little de-ja-vu? Return to old files; new solutions might be lying dormant there. Ask yourself what this new opportunity has in common with older challenges. In analysis, take into account all influences, including those beyond your control." 
		, spirituality: "Behold the delicate machinery of heaven! As you watch events unfold, keep your perspective. What seems impossible to understand today will make sense with the passing of time. Look for the larger patterns."
		, personalGrowth: "The actions you take today will influence your reality for days and years to come. Making wise choices now can free you from the unpleasant business of enduring repercussions further down the road."
		, fortuneTelling: "Some events are in the hands of heaven. You've lived through this before. What happened then?"
		},
		
		{ name: "Justice"
		, relationships: "Relationships are rarely 50/50 propositions, but the closer you come to an even division of responsibility, the better. What do you really need to be satisfied? Knowing your standards empowers you to evaluate your feelings more clearly."
		, work: "Work toward a more equitable division of labor. Learn to delegate. Evaluate your own work using the same standard you bring to bear on the work of others. Know what matters most, and prioritize accordingly." 
		, spirituality: "In all things, seek balance. When faced with a decision, quiet your mind and allow your heart to weigh the moment. Trust in the law of karma; avoid personal efforts to mete out universal justice."
		, personalGrowth: "Everyone faces limitations of some kind. Learn your own limits. Rather than allow them to define you, use what you know to better position yourself for success. Learn when to say yes; know when to say no."
		, fortuneTelling: "A legal verdict will be rendered soon. Someone is making a decision. You need to get the facts."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Hanged Man"
		, relationships: "What doesn't move forward isn't growing. If you're hanging by a thread, it might be time to grab the scissors. If you can learn from what's not working, do so, but don't equate learning with having to stay."
		, work: "Occasionally, no amount of effort will move a project to completion; progress simply isn't the cards, despite your best efforts. Learn from setbacks; turn disappointment into opportunity." 
		, spirituality: "Sometimes the best action is no action at all. Suspend your need to have a hand in things. Consider, too, the value of small sacrifices. What you give away will come back to you greatly multiplied."
		, personalGrowth: "One sign of maturity is your ability to deal effectively with the unexpected. Rather than be decimated, look for the lesson. If you're true to your own values, no disaster will get the best of you."
		, fortuneTelling: "A traitor is revealed. One of your friends is working against you. Change your ways or suffer the consequences."
		},
		
		{ name: "Death"
		, relationships: "Identify what's not working and put it behind you. Take stock, too, of the relationship itself. Dying flames can be rekindled with mutual effort, but embrace an ending if, in fact, an ending is what's best for you. Poets used to call orgasm the little death so, at times, this card can also point to a consummated relationship!"
		, work: "Close out lingering projects and tie up loose ends. Now is a good time to consider all your options, including the possibility of moving on. Alternatively, you could put an end to feelings of unrest by deciding, once and for all, to stay put. Do what's best for you." 
		, spirituality: "Spiritual scribes write of dying to the world realizing that the physical world and its concerns are illusory at best. For you, the Death card is a reminder to focus on what really matters. Alternatively, the card can suggest a need to contact or honor your ancestors."
		, personalGrowth: "Grasping the short, fleeting nature of life is one of life's hardest and most sobering lessons. Acknowledging your own impermanence can help you live your life more fully."
		, fortuneTelling: "A relationship or illness ends suddenly. Limit travel and risk-taking. General gloom and doom."
		},
		
		{ name: "Temperance"
		, relationships: "Set superficial relationships aside. Pursue trust and deep intimacy the subtle blending of two people into one. Bring people together. Commit to introductions, parties, or gatherings. Seek out groups."
		, work: "Many hands make work easier. Call meetings. Get input from every level at every step. If everyone has a hand in defining an effort, then everyone will feel ownership and investment. Moderate your tendency toward all-or-nothing work habits." 
		, spirituality: "Some spiritual advisors recommend extreme practices, from fasting to abstinence, as a means of boosting spiritual awareness. Consider the potential value of moderation in all things. You can value what is right here, right now, without craving more or surpassing healthy limits."
		, personalGrowth: "Young people want to toss out tradition and forge ahead. Older people are more conservative. Between these extremes lies a healthier middle ground. Define the polarities and then ask, What lies between?"
		, fortuneTelling: "Someone's using drugs or alcohol to excess. It's time to get back on that diet."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Devil"
		, relationships: "Avoid the temptation to blame everything on everyone else; own your own contribution to the relationship's success or failure. Doing what feels good is not always the best strategy. Take care that sexual attraction plays a healthy role; resist the tendency to be dominated by cravings."
		, work: "The bottom line is important, but not all-important. Do not allow material concerns to obscure human issues. There's nothing wrong with enjoying or being compensated for good work√ëbut keep the money in perspective. Know when to say, Enough's enough." 
		, spirituality: "Many traditions position the body as bad or evil, something unclean. In your own spiritual practice, consider the wisdom of relishing the body and its spectrum of sensations. You can honor the pleasures of the body without being enslaved by them."
		, personalGrowth: "Be honest: what habit or attitude holds you back most? You might find that the qualities you most detest in others are, in fact, reflections of your darkest self. Rather than be chained to old attitudes or habits, embrace your shortcomings and strive to make more conscious choices."
		, fortuneTelling: "Adultery and unfaithfulness. A string of extremely bad luck is coming your way. Beware evil influences and wolves in sheep's clothing."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Tower"
		, relationships: "Extinguish old flames before they have an opportunity to dampen promising new relationships. Despite the pain involved, a clean break is healthier than a lingering, drawn-out departure. Break down the walls and communicate honestly about what's really happening."
		, work: "Sacrifice some sacred cows. Harsh criticism from above can clear ground for a new breakthrough. Something is blocking progress; identify it and boldly sweep it aside. Document everything; should the climate suddenly change, you want your ducks in a row." 
		, spirituality: "Loss clears away the debris of the past, opening up new ground for new growth. As your heart opens, let old scar tissue fall away. Rather than live in fear of sudden loss, recognize that none of us owns anything. Practice detachment."
		, personalGrowth: "Identify what holds you back and attack it. Embrace bold change. Criticism may come; if so, search each barbed word for a kernel of much-needed truth. Some of life's greatest lessons are tough ones! With time, a bruised ego can become fertile ground for personal growth and maturity."
		, fortuneTelling: "Impending disaster. Cancel plans and reverse decisions. Someone wants to take you down a notch or two. Don't hold back; say what you really mean."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Star"
		, relationships: "Give freely of yourself and expect the best. Don't hold back genuine emotions; express them without shame. Consider exploring spiritual goals together. Astrology can offer important insights into compatibility. Let your honesty and openness encourage others to reveal their deepest thoughts."
		, work: "Surround yourself with visual reminders of your goal because these can serve as guiding lights when you need a way to put the situation into perspective. Expect the best of yourself and your co-workers. You'll know when the time is right to take action; have confidence in your own judgment." 
		, spirituality: "Prayer and quiet time communicate your openness to guidance from above. Don't hesitate to share your spiritual side with those around you. Seek out oracles. Allow the power of spirit to flow through you; let your spirituality color all aspects of your life."
		, personalGrowth: "An optimist sees what is ... and what can be. Open yourself to possibility. Numbers never tell the whole story. Shed your ego; be yourself, no matter what others think. The only truly unique thing you have to share is the person you really are. Unmask!"
		, fortuneTelling: "Get an astrology chart drawn up. Someone is a little too starstruck. What's happening now has long been fore-ordained."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Moon"
		, relationships: "Moonlight becomes you, so don't be afraid to indulge in a little romantic lunacy. Navigating your way to a fulfilling relationship involves risks. Some people will say you're crazy. Pay attention to your instincts, surround yourself with loyal guides, and make your move."
		, work: "Avoid linear/logical approaches and go with your gut. Brainstorm. Put the rules aside and use your imagination. What would happen if restrictions were removed? What might happen? What could happen? A little lunacy can be a good thing; blow off steam, change your habits, and try working in a different light." 
		, spirituality: "How does your personal spiritual path incorporate the Divine Feminine? What qualities would a divine mother offer? Which aspects of your personal spirituality would benefit from a feminine touch? How might contact with the divine feminine benefit you today? How might you honor or invite that energy?"
		, personalGrowth: "Faced with an uncertain future, you might feel led to abandon your search for self and crawl back into your shell. You can move forward without tossing caution to the wind. Uncertainty can be the mother of great creativity. Listen your instincts, clarify your path, and keep going."
		, fortuneTelling: "Watch for problems at the end of the month. Someone you know needs to howl at the moon more often. Someone is about to change his or her mind about an important decision."
		},
		
		{ name: "The Sun"
		, relationships: "You're turning heads without realizing it. Attention is coming your way and you deserve it! The admiration of others is a warm glow, so bask in it while you can. As all things begin to revolve around you, take care you don't get blinded or burned by your own brilliance."
		, work: "With the proper strategy, you're all set to be the golden boy (or girl). Approval and praise are the order of the day. Accept all this admiration with humbleness; give credit where credit's due. Meanwhile, make hay while the sun shines. Remember: after noon, the rest of the day is a sunset!" 
		, spirituality: "As your meditative and spiritual practices hone your sensitivities, you begin to feel your connectedness to the energies around you. Branch out. Spread warmth, love, and joy through your attitudes and actions. Today, embody the universal light."
		, personalGrowth: "Learn to win gracefully. Accept compliments with a humble heart. You can acknowledge and celebrate your own achievements without falling prey to greediness. Be who you are. You've earned this moment, but don't let pride in your progress hinder further growth!"
		, fortuneTelling: "Everything's coming up roses (or sunflowers, whatever the case may be). Whatever's on your mind, go for it because you can't lose today."
		},
		
		{ name: "Judgement"
		, relationships: "Freshen your relationship by taking advantage of opportunities to reinvent yourself and each other. Swap roles. Seek out entertainment you would normally avoid. Shatter habits and breath new life into your partnerships. What you learn in the process could be a wake-up call for you both."
		, work: "If something or someone is holding you back, it's time for a Come to Jesus Meeting -- a time to air dirty laundry, read someone the riot act, or say out loud what, to this point, has only been said in private. Identify the problem and eliminate it before the decay spreads to other efforts. If things are going well, use this as an opportunity to define why, so you can replicate your success elsewhere." 
		, spirituality: "With a shock, we realize the impermanent nature of this world. Use this sudden insight to your advantage. Answer the trumpet call and reinvent yourself by refusing to cling to distractions. Set aside your stumbling blocks and embrace transformation."
		, personalGrowth: "The assessments of others cannot impact your true value. The only standard you must meet is being the very best version of yourself you can be. Identify your next steps ... and take them. Don't do this for others; do it for you."
		, fortuneTelling: "An old issue you thought was over will come up again today. Get ready for huge changes: break-ups, sudden calls from old friends, and unexpected setbacks. God's trying to get your attention."
		},
		
		{ name: "The World"
		, relationships: "With mutual trust and effort, very different people can come together to create a reality greater than the sum of its parts. Once you have a taste of what can be, settling for less will be difficult. Keep in mind, though, that a dream of perfection can foster dissatisfaction with an otherwise perfectly good relationship."
		, work: "Synergy! It's possible for everyone involved to work together in harmony to create something better than any one person could produce on his or her own. Encourage people to share ideas. Allow others to share in the investment and the glory. Unite and meet your goals." 
		, spirituality: "Enlightenment is a goal; reaching it is bliss. Rather than beat yourself up for falling short, celebrate your progress. Meantime, keep in mind the lesson of the Tarot: Even as we reach one level of enlightenment, we become a fool again."
		, personalGrowth: "For most challenges, both intuitive and logical approaches exist. Most of us favor one over the other, but the secret to true mastery involves learning to wield both with perfect facility. Identify your least favorite approach, and then speed your growth by giving it special attention."
		, fortuneTelling: "Winning the lottery. Getting your heart's desire. Having everything you ever imagined having."
		},
		
		{ name: "Ace of Wands"
		, relationships: "This could be the start of something big. It's time to evaluate what you really want; once you do, you can decide whether or not this opportunity can take you there. Be careful: overwhelming attraction can distort good judgment."
		, work: "The only way to stop moving in circles is to define clear criteria for success. What's the goal? What do you need in order to achieve it? What steps must be taken to get from A to B? This card heralds the need for absolute clarity. Anything less breeds confusion." 
		, spirituality: "Where does your spiritual path lead? Walking a path without direction amounts to wandering in the wilderness: you may have some amazing experiences, but there's no easy way to measure progress. What signs of evolution should you see as you grow?"
		, personalGrowth: "Where should you be in five years? In ten years? Rather than float like a leaf on the river, consider the value of setting standards for yourself. In addition to defining a direction, give yourself milestones to meet. Before you know it, your dreams will be realities."
		, fortuneTelling: "Someone has the hots for you. A new job offer is coming your way. Walk softly, and carry a big stick."
		},
		
		{ name: "Two of Wands"
		, relationships: "To what extent does everyone involved in your situation want the same thing? The actions people take reveal their true inclinations. To gain insight into the goals of others, study what they do. Are their actions in line with their stated goals? Are yours?"
		, work: "No one can serve two masters. Before proceeding, determine exactly how much authority you have in this matter. In addition, it's time to decide which To Do items move you closer to your personal goals...and which ones are merely consuming your limited time and energy." 
		, spirituality: "Others will have their opinions, but ultimately, you must decide what spiritual practices are right for you. Speak your mind and share your own views with courage and honesty. Answering the call of Spirit may dictate taking the road less traveled by."
		, personalGrowth: "While others become slaves to fashion and convention, you should work to express yourself. What sets you apart? What makes you unique? These are qualities worth celebrating. Rather than give in to brow-beating and peer pressure, set your own standards in all things."
		, fortuneTelling: "Beware false friends. Don't be mealy-mouthed; say what you think and do what you want to do."
		},
		
		{ name: "Three of Wands"
		, relationships: "Knowing what you want or need does you no good if you don't come up with a plan for achieving it! It's time to expand your horizons: go places you've never been, try sports you've never tried, meet people you've overlooked. As your world expands, so do your opportunities."
		, work: "Lead by doing. Forge ahead with your plans, but don't forget to show others what you're doing and why you're doing it. Be proactive, brainstorming obstacles and minting solutions before breakdowns occur. Define very clearly your criteria for success and measure progress daily." 
		, spirituality: "Rather than look for a guru or a well-worn path, take the spiritual initiative. If you could express your spirituality in any way, what form would you choose? If you could worship anywhere, where would you go? Break the mold. Remember: bearing new fruit takes time."
		, personalGrowth: "Routine is the enemy of growth. Take new roads. See new sights. Pick a new hobby. Order the menu items you don't recognize. Make a habit of blazing new trails."
		, fortuneTelling: "You'll be planning a trip soon. Be on the lookout: your ship is coming in."
		},
		
		{ name: "Four of Wands"
		, relationships: "Have you been together for ten years? Celebrate. Have you been together ten days? Celebrate. Do something to recognize the contribution of both partners. Alone? Celebrate yourself."
		, work: "Assign duties, delegate, and get out of the way. Allow others to contribute, even if their contributions aren't exactly up to your personal standards. When projects end, thank everyone involved in a meaningful way." 
		, spirituality: "It's easy to allow any ritual to become empty. Get back in touch with what your rituals were meant to teach or inspire. When you restore meaning to your spiritual practice, every prayer becomes a celebration."
		, personalGrowth: "You can amplify individual achievements by becoming part of a group. Without decreasing the importance of your own contribution, you'll achieve more...and have more to celebrate, too."
		, fortuneTelling: "Someone is watching and evaluating your work. You may get a wedding invitation soon."
		},

Remember: you are not your emotions. Withdraw. Breathe. Save anger for those few transgressions worthy of such a powerful emotion."

		, personalGrowth: "If at first you don't succeed, try again. It's an old clich≈Ω, but an important mantra for anyone determined to make the most of what he or she has been given. If recent efforts have fallen short, you must make a choice: despair...or embody the spirit of determination."

		, work: "Occasionally, one person's success will bring about another person's loss. When you're the successful one, don't gloat; be humble. When you suffer the loss, don't despair; pick up the pieces and move on. Don't drive yourself crazy asking Why? Breaking a rule may prove to be the key to innovation." 
		, spirituality: "Suffering is a fact of life. How does your spiritual path deal with the reality of suffering or the pain of inequality? It's easy to be spiritual when all is well. Insulate yourself from instability by thinking√ëin advance of how you'll deal with adversity when it comes your way."

Act with integrity, and demand integrity in those closest to you. If you've wronged someone, accept the consequences."

		, work: "Some restrictions are necessary; others are merely tradition. Ethics demand you play by the rules; sacred cows, however, are fair game. What are the obstacles, exactly? If your limits didn't exist, how might you move forward? Thinking freely will open unexpected options." 
		, spirituality: "The free spirit cannot be contained by the physical constraints. As you learn to cultivate balance and focus, you may find that most obstacles are self-imposed and most limits are strictly imaginary. When you focus your will, blindfolds and bonds will fall away."
		, personalGrowth: "Knowing your own limits is important; respect them. Whatever the issue, you're balking for a reason. There's no harm in refusing to move forward for now, and no shame in saying, No. A mature person communicates what he or she needs with absolute confidence."

		, spirituality: "Everyone has regrets. Rather than be strangled by them, use your regrets as a means of enhancing empathy for others. Understanding that we've all made mistakes can help us remember to cut everyone a little slack. Use your pain to gain insight into the pain others feel."
		, personalGrowth: "Worry wastes energy. If something happens, it happens; the energy expended on worry won't change a thing. Do what you can do, and let the Universe handle the rest. Maturity dictates letting go of unhealthy obsessions and learning to be happy with the here and now."

		, work: "Know when to say when. Continuing to take on more work and more responsibility is not the answer here. Be honest about your limits. If they've been exceeded, ask for relief. Diverting some of the work may mean eating some crow, but beats a complete systems failure later on." 
		, spirituality: "It's hard to keep your eyes on heaven when you're face-down on the ground. When darkness overwhelms us, we may be tempted to abandon Spirit entirely. Finding just one thing to be thankful for, though, may provide you with the key to turning things around."
		, personalGrowth: "Failure is a cruel but powerful teacher. When possible, make corrections before hitting bottom. If that time has passed, the mature thing to do is accept consequences, resolve to do better, and start the process of making amends. As they say: live one day at a time."

		, spirituality: "Spend time with whatever Scripture governs your path. Read books. Consult oracles. Ask a guide, priest, priestess, or other minister the questions that cloud your mind. Prayers for wisdom and patience can open doors to new insights and spiritual discoveries."
		, personalGrowth: "Keep your mind young by playing the role of the perpetual student. Enroll in a course. Visit a museum. See a movie you'd normally avoid. Ask someone who enjoys an art you find annoying to explain what he or she loves about it. Do all you can to shift perspective and see the world from new and exciting angles."

		, work: "Ask good questions. Before rendering judgment, be sure you have all the facts. Refrain from cutting others short; even if you've heard it all before, give others a chance to share their ideas. Resist the urge to correct; open the door to free-wheeling creativity before you become an editor."

		, personalGrowth: "Rather than be defensive, relax. Give criticism a chance. A mature person acknowledges his or her capacity for improvement, and isn't intimidated by the observations of others. Take what will help you; discard the rest."

Identify what must be changed, but express that change in terms of growth and benefit. Instead of problems, see challenges. Instead of deficits, see opportunities."

		, spirituality: "Listen for the still, small voice, and, when you've heard it, act on its advice with total confidence. Don√ït hesitate to confirm your verdict with a wise counselor whose opinions you respect. Be sure to let your spirituality temper your conversation, and match your words with deeds."

An opportunity to possess more may come your way. To prevent imbalance, have your ethics clearly in mind, and be prepared to manage your new resources wisely."

		, work: "How well do you balance demands of work and life? Remember: you should be working to live, not living to work. If the job is dominating your schedule, press back. If unfettered playtime is ruining your productivity, sober yourself by tallying up the time and money lost to distractions." 
		, spirituality: "Of the many options you have for service, which will ultimately do everyone the most good? Identify your skills and talents, and use these as a means of illuminating your own best contribution. Pair your resources with those of other, like-minded people and get twice as much done in half the time."

The health of any relationship is directly related to the effort both partners make to fulfill their obligations. If you haven't discussed terms, do so."
		, work: "It's time to review contracts and agreements. To what extent do you deliver an honest day's work? To what extent is this fairly compensated? If you agreed to work for a certain price, you should fulfill that agreement, even if you underestimated the time and effort involved in a project. A formula for success: know what you need, ask for it up front, and deliver more than promised." 
		, spirituality: "In return for dedicated pursuit, a spiritual path should yield focus, fulfillment, and peace. To what extent is your own spiritual practice delivering the promised changes in mind, body, and prosperity? It may be time to evaluate what you're giving ... and receiving."
		, personalGrowth: "Integrity is a fragile thing; one broken promise or one unmet commitment can shatter it forever. If you are out of integrity with someone, it's time to correct the situation by admitting fault and accepting consequences. If someone is out of integrity with you, you'll have to decide what value you place on giving them a second chance."

Too little spending and too little sex starve the soul, making everyone bitter. The healthier the relationship, the more generous the spirits of those involved."

Every short-cut and every opportunity to save has a cost. Be sure your approach is appropriate for the time." 
		, spirituality: "A stingy spirit hampers growth. You simply cannot give more than the Universe can return! Let love, compassion, and interest in others flow freely. Share insights and personal stories. Open yourself to new experiences, new companions, and new points of view. Review your charitable contributions; is it possible to give more?"

If you accept offers of aid from loved ones, be sure you define and stick to the terms of repayment, or be prepared to lose the relationship."
		, work: "Too few customers. Too few innovations. Too few resources. All too often, we focus on what we lack. Turn this around by taking a fresh look at the resources you do have. Watch for offers of help. Consider mergers and partnerships. Rather than focus on the deficits, consider what could be."

Don't forget, though, that prayers and compassionate meditation can also change the world for good. Whatever form of service your spiritual path encourages, offer it with sincerity and regularity."

		, spirituality: "Which are you more likely to do: look back on wasted days or focus on a brighter future? The past is the past; let it go. If you haven't achieved, spiritually speaking, what you hoped to achieve by now, deepen your resolve, set new goals, and pray for the strength to achieve them."
		, personalGrowth: "You can waste an entire lifetime wrestling with regrets. Escape the trap. Shift your focus from the past to the future, and resolve to make the most of the here and now.

Even if the task is an ordinary one, strive to make today's product extraordinary. Others may not notice the difference√ëbut you will." 
		, spirituality: "Rituals can feel silly, and formal prayer can feel stiff and unnatural. Today, though, invest a little extra time and energy into your spiritual observations. Choose something to wear that reflects your faith. Acquire a special item for a home altar. Be in the moment, devoting extra attention to the small details of your faith."
